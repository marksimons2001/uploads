This blog is purely a place where contents of the book ‘Overseas Filipino Workers’ 
are showcased. The book is a compilation of articles and short stories written and 
published  online by the author via her topic on Suite101.com between August 1999 
to December 2002. The book has recorded a part of the history of the OFW phenomenon 
and can be used as reference for studies or research touching the lives of OFWs.

The back cover shows a blurb by Ruby Bayan, a freelance writer based in the USA:

 overseas Filipino workers. Through the stories and insights she shared in her column
 in Suite101.com, she became the voice of thousands of hardworking kabayans pursuing their
 hopes and dreams while facing tough challenges in foreign soil.”
